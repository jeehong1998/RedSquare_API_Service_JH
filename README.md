# RedSquare_API_Service_JH

This project is a Node.js application that utilizes the Express library to build two endpoints. The first endpoint generates a random unique hash string using the SHA-256 algorithm and returns it after 1 second. The second endpoint requests a hash string from the first endpoint and returns a success response body only when the last character of the hash is an odd number. This project is designed to demonstrate how to build and use endpoints in an Express application.
